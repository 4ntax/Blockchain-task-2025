/**
 * @title Upgradeable Proxy Contract
 * New
 * @notice 
 * 1. Contract Purpose:
 *    The UpgradeableProxy contract is designed to enable the deployment of upgradeable smart contracts.
 *    It separates contract logic from data storage, allowing the underlying logic (implementation) to be changed
 *    without losing the stored state. This is crucial for long-term smart contract systems that may require upgrades
 *    due to bugs, new features, or improvements.
 * 
 * 2. Key Features Used:
 *    - Proxy pattern using delegatecall for executing logic contract functions in the context of the proxy.
 *    - Admin-controlled upgrade mechanism to point to new logic contracts.
 *    - Preservation of data across upgrades.
 *    - Fallback and receive functions to redirect all calls to the current logic implementation.
 * 
 * 3. Technical Concepts Used:
 *    - `delegatecall`: Low-level Solidity operation that allows a contract to call another contract's code
 *      while keeping the context (storage, balance, msg.sender) of the calling contract.
 *    - Proxy Design Pattern: A smart contract pattern that separates contract state (storage) from contract logic.
 *    - Admin Access Control: Only the admin can upgrade the contract to a new implementation.
 *    - Low-level assembly: Used in fallback function to handle `delegatecall` mechanics.
 * 
 * 4. Code Comments:
 *    The code is thoroughly commented with clear explanations of the logic for proxy delegation, upgrade mechanism,
 *    and storage handling.
